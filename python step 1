#this code will return the volume of a square based pyramid

#this function sets the parameter as base and height and defines the function as: volume of square based pyramid
def vol_sqr_pyramid (base, height):
#calculates the total volume using the formula - (base^2 * height)/3
    total_volume = (((base ** 2) * height) / 3)
#returns user the total volume of a square based pyramid 
#the variable, total, contains the mathematical operations for the answer
    return total_volume
