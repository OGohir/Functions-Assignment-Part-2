The way I determined if my function was correct, was printing the actual value of the volume of a square based pyramid. To the code, i added: 

print(vol_sqr_pyramid(2, 3))

This will ensure that the first parameter which is base (as seen in the code):
(def vol_sqr_pyramid (base, height)

Is the value of 2 and the value of height is equal to 3.

Since the variables have value, now when you do the math that is in the value of ‘total’. It will equal:

     total_volume = (((base ** 2) * height) / 3)
     total_volume = (((2^2) * 3) /3)
     total_volume = ((4 * 3) /3)
     total_volume = (12/3)
     total_volume = 4.0

This means that the value that is returned to the user (total) is equal to 4.0 

This is what my code looked like for determining that my function is correct:

#Omaima Gohir
#4/3/2023
#this code will return the volume of a square based pyramid

#this function sets the parameter as base and height and defines the function as: volume of square based pyramid
def vol_sqr_pyramid (base, height):
#calculates the total volume using the formula - (base^2 * height)/3
    total_volume = (((base ** 2) * height) / 3)
#returns user the total volume of a square based pyramid 
#the variable, total, contains the mathematical operations for the answer
    return total_volume
#sets the variable base as 2, and height as 3 and prints the volume in float point form
Volume = (vol_sqr_pyramid(2, 3))

The answer that is printed is: 4.0

Therefore, my code is correct by using the print formula.
